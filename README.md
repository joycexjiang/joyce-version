## Project Overview

### Target User Population
MealMate targets college students who face challenges in coordinating meal times with their friends due to varying schedules.

### Problem Statement
College students often struggle to sync their schedules with friends for meals. MealMate aims to simplify this process by allowing users to sync their calendars, find free times, and schedule meals effortlessly.

### Brief Description of Prototype
The prototype begins with an onboarding process where users can create an account manually or sign up using their Google or Apple accounts. Key features include adding friends, creating groups, setting up connected calendars, indicating availability, and scheduling meals. The main landing page highlights overlapping free times among friends for meal planning.
